            <h1>Honduras Missions</h1>

            <p>Mission Honduras has been Jasonâ€™s newest international mission emphasis. His teams work alongside the <a href="http://www.micahprojecthonduras.org/">Micah Project</a>.,an organization ministering in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Micah Project has two group homes for young men and boys, an outreach to street children and a variety of other ministries to the neediest people in the city. The team not only has the opportunity to minister to the boys in the home but also reach out into the community in which they live. This mission trip takes place the first week of December and is open to believers that are at least 18 years old and have the desire to pour out their lives into the lives of the Micah Project boys.

            <h1>Zimbabwe Missions</h1>

            <p>For over a decade, Jason has been leading mission teams to Zimbabwe. Each year he assembles a team of believers to go and work alongside local churches, helping them to be the beacon of hope in their communities. The teams use medical and vision clinics, Bible School, church construction and crusades to use the gifts of each team member and to touch the lives of many. Annually, Jason is seeking doctors, nurses, teachers, preachers, contractors and faithful disciples who are willing to pour out their hearts into the lives of others. The mission typically takes place in late May and is open to believers that are over the age of 18, unless accompanied by a parent.
