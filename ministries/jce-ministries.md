JC Evangelistic Ministries was established in 2005 as Jason began his full-time evangelism ministry. After Jason joined Kingdom Building Ministries in 2012, JCEM has focused its attention on seeking out and helping other new and upcoming evangelists get their start in ministry. JCEM still holds true to its mission of proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ through preaching, teaching, and missions. The ministry is dedicated to assisting the local church through evangelistic preaching and training, and giving hope to people here and abroad through mission evangelism. Jason still serves as the President of JCEM and oversees its ministries.
