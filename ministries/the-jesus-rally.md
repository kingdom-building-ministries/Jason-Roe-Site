[The Jesus Rally](http://www.jrally.com) is an outdoor Worship Festival located in the foothills of the Smoky Mountains in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.  It takes place at the RiverBend Campground.  The Jesus Rally launched in 1997 to provide a place for youth groups that didn’t have the means to attend other Christian music festivals.  

The Jesus Rally creates a space for people to encounter Christ through worship and preaching.  For four nights, each July, thousands gather for the annual Jesus Rally at the RiverBend. The event is free, camping is free, The Gospel is free and even the T-shirts are free!  All are welcome! Visit [www.jrally.com](http://www.jrally.com) to register and learn more about this year’s FREE event.
