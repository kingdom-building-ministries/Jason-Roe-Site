[Resurrection](http://www.resurrectionyouth.com) is a winter retreat that takes place in Gatlinburg Tennessee each January. The mission of Resurrection is

>*“…to be the premier Christian youth conference that brings youth groups together for awesome fellowship and authentic worship, where the Gospel is proclaimed, and youth have a spiritual renewal and learn to have a closer walk with Christ.”*  

Youth Pastors bring their youth group and as they gather with thousands of others, encounter a winter retreat like no other. This is not just a concert. Resurrection is a group-building, life-changing dynamic place to bring your youth group!
