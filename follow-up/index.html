            <p>I’m so glad you chose to come here for more resources that will help you grow. Taking new growth steps in faith is an essential part of the journey of a follower of Christ. Whether you’ve made a first-time commitment or a deeper commitment to Christ, it is important to find practices and disciplines that are going to keep you strong and growing in your faith. Here are five practices to begin to develop as you continue your faith journey.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Pray – Walk in a spirit of prayer</li>

                <li>Study – Get into God’s word and read books that speak to your current place in the journey</li>

                <li>Worship – Find a local church to gather with others in worship</li>

                <li>Serve – Find ways to serve others and share the Love of Christ with them</li>

                <li>Give – Give of your resources. This not only means tithing but also time.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>

            <p>In addition to these five simple practices in developing your relationship with God, you can explore more opportunities under the ‘<a href="/get-involved">Get Involved</a>’ section. There is information on joining Jason on a short term mission trip or attending a discipleship training opportunity with <a href="http://www.kbm.org">Kingdom Building Ministries</a>. May you continue to faithfully follow Jesus and follow His direction for your life.</p>
